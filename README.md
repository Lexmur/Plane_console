# Plane_console
Hello! This is my first pet project!
In my program, I worked on the skill of working with structures in C ++, and also practiced writing working code.
The plane_console program is able to create an airplane in vector, allocate seats for passengers and keep some data about the tourist. Also you can check in a person for a flight and cancel the reservation.
